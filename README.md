# Clustering Project: Books Recommender System

This project implements a books recommender system using the Nearest Neighbors classical clustering model. The system suggests books based on their similarity to other books in the dataset, which is located in the `dataset/` folder.

## Introduction
The books recommender system leverages the Nearest Neighbors algorithm to cluster similar books and recommend books based on their proximity to others. This clustering approach ensures that users receive book recommendations similar to the ones they have shown interest in.

## Features
- **Nearest Neighbors Clustering:** Recommends books based on their similarity to other books in the dataset.
- **Efficient Recommendations:** The system uses a classical machine learning model for fast and scalable book recommendations.
- **Customizable:** Users can tune the number of neighbors to control the diversity of recommendations.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is provided in the `dataset/` folder, which includes book metadata necessary for building the recommender system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clustering-project-books-recommender-system.git
    cd clustering-project-books-recommender-system
    ```

2. (Optional) Set up Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Recommender System
To get book recommendations, run the following script:

```bash
python app.py
```

Once the script is running, input the title of a book, and the system will recommend a list of similar books based on the Nearest Neighbors model.

### Data Preprocessing
The system preprocesses the book data, converting metadata into features that can be used for clustering and recommendations.

### Book Recommendations
The Nearest Neighbors algorithm computes the closest books in the dataset to the userâ€™s input and returns the top N similar books.

## Algorithm Used

- **Nearest Neighbors:** A classical clustering algorithm that finds the closest points (books) in feature space, allowing for efficient similarity-based recommendations.
